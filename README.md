# Satellite Tracker 1.0
## A Group 8 Project ðŸŒŽ

For the first project of this bootcamp, our group decided to build a satellite tracker. We designed this site with a specific User Story in mind, one that centered around astrophotography. Based on that, we built a site that showcases 4 of the most popular space objects orbiting Earth. Not only that, we were also able to utilize users' locations through their own input in order to predict when a particular satellite might flyover them! Paired with N2YO's REST API, we also implemented NASA's APOD API to provide pictures and inspiration for the astrophotographers visiting our site.
