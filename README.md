# Satellite Tracker ðŸ›°
## A Group 8 Project ðŸŒŽ
For the first project of this bootcamp, our group decided to build a satellite tracker. We designed this site with a specific User Story in mind, one that centered around astrophotography. Based on that, we built a site that showcases 4 of the most popular space objects orbiting Earth. Upon selection, a map is populated with the current location of one of the four satellites through N2YO's REST API. WE also aired NASA'S APOD API with N2Y0's in order to provide pictures and inspiration for the astrophotographers visiting our site.
## Construction and Collaboration 
From the get go, Group 8 had great communication and a solid vision of what we needed to accomplish over the next 2 weeks. Work and development was split up by what each team member stated as their strongsuit. The site's HTML and CSS were mostly handled and designed by Autumn Y and the backend development was built by Deena S and Andres G. However, whenever someone asked for help, it was always met with the other 2 teammates input. 
- Overall we were able to accomplish the following:
    - Build a javaScript file from scratch that handled data from both API's
    - Design and add functionality to our Satellite Tracker homepage
    - Take user input (user location) and save it to localStorage
    - Strengthen our knowledge of all 3 languages used including jQuery
    - Foster a welcoming environment so that each member felt comfortable making mistakes and with learning new technology
#### The following shows the languages used for this project:
* HTML
