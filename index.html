                    Available to view today are The International Space Station,
                    The Hubble Space Telescope, The Chinese Space Station, and GOES-16.
                    Launch dates for these satellites range from 1990 all the way to 2021!
                    Each satellite has its own unique purpose and mission, which we will go into down below. &#8595;

                <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info-light">
                    The <span class="special is-italic has-text-weight-bold">International Space Station</span> was launched back in November 1998. 
                    Its purpose is to provide space to conduct and perform unique scientific
                    and technological investigations in a microgravity environment. The main 
                    objective of the crew is to support scientific research and track weather 
                    phenomena across North America.

                    The <span class='special is-italic has-text-weight-bold'>Hubble Space Telescope</span> is one of the most well-known space objects. 
                    It was launched back in April 1990 as a part of NASA's Discovery launch and continues 
                    to capture pictures from Earth's orbit to this day. It gets its name from astronomer 
                    Edwin Hubble and is renowned as a vital tool in scientific research. Its launch was 
                    intended for 1983, but after the Challenger tragedy, it was delayed. Luckily, the Hubble 
                    made it into orbit, becoming one of the most important tools to astronomy today!

                    The <span class='special is-italic has-text-weight-bold'>Chinese Space Station</span> was launched relatively recently in April 2021. 
                    Its purpose is to host a range of international experiments through collaboration
                    with the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs for at least 10 years. 
                    China hopes to potentially include foreign astronauts and further modules in the 
                    coming years.

                    <span class='special is-italic has-text-weight-bold'>GOES-16</span> (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - 16) is a weather 
                    satellite launched and operated by NASA and NOAA back in November 2016. 
                    Its main mission is to provide weather reports for the Americas, but it 
                    also monitors and reports data for space weather and the Sun! GOES-16 was 
                    also called GOES-R and was the first of its kind to be launched into low-orbit. 
                    Its expected lifespan is 15 years so it's already 5 years into its journey!
